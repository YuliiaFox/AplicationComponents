Create app, that will access device contacts.
You can found "how to" here: https://developer.android.com/training/contacts-provider/retrieve-names
1. App must show list of user contacts. Show just name and phone number in list.
2. Click on contact item must open "Details" page with additional info (Name, organization, email, phone number)
3. Email and phone must be clickable, and click by them must open device email composer or send phone to dial.
4. Add view at the bottom of screen which would represent current charging state ("Charging connected/Charging disconnected"). You can use image instead of text label if want. Charging state should update dynamically, without app relaunch.
